# Introduction
This repository houses the content of a web site to support the Stage 3 and Stage 4 Advanced Laboratories in the UCD School of Physics.

This website was originally built starting with the Book Template from the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [Academic / Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com) but in summer 2024 it was changed to Hugo Blox (the latest iteration of Hugo Academic / Wowchemy). There are significant changes to the structre and presentation with Hugo Blox (it appears to have bugs, unimplemented (e.g. staticref and list_children shortcodes were missing and had to be copied in locally) and undocumented features.
