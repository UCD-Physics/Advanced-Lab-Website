## Introduction

The [National Instruments USB
6008](https://www.ni.com/en-ie/support/model.usb-6008.html) is a
multi-function USB Data Acquisition device. There is also a
higher-performance version, the [USB 6009](https://www.ni.com/en-ie/support/model.usb-6009.html),
of which there are a couple in the APL, but they are identical to program.
