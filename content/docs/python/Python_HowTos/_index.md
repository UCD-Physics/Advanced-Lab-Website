This section will provide a 'how-to' on many basic concepts in Python,
Numpy, Scipy and Jupyter Notebooks, . The aim of this is to provide a
reference for anyone who needs reminding of how to do certain tasks in
Python.

The links below will
take you to the UCD Physics 'How-To' repository on GitHub.

Here, you can browse
through the material, but if you wish to run the code or edit it to
help your understanding, you can **click the 'open in colab' link** which
will bring you to a webpage where you can easily run the code
yourself!

{{% callout warning %}} The Jupyter notebooks should be rendered on
Github. However, some old browsers do not show the rendered notebooks. If the notebooks do not render then please
try another browser.  {{% /callout %}}
