This section will provide  'how-to's on many basic concepts in Python,
Numpy, Scipy and Jupyter Notebooks. The aim of this is to provide a
reference for anyone who needs reminding of how to do certain tasks in
Python.

The links below will
take you to the UCD Physics 'How-To' repository on GitHub.

Here, you can browse
through the material, but if you wish to run the code or edit it to
help your understanding, you can **click the 'open in colab' link** which
will bring you to a webpage where you can easily run the code
yourself!

{{% callout warning %}} The Jupyter notebooks should be rendered
statically on Github from which you can click the colab link to open
in Google Colab. However, some old browsers do not show the GitHub-rendered
notebooks. If the notebooks do not render then please try another
browser.  {{% /callout %}}
