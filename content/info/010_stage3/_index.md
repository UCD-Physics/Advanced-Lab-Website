## Introductory Sessions


To help Stage3 students get up to speed Python, Data Analysis and
Data Acquisiton a series of lectures and hands-on introductory sessions
will be held.

For the Autumn 2020 trimester these sessions will be held on Zoom with
links circulated by email.

Please see the [schedule](###Schedule)
for information on sessions and links to material. **The deadline for
handing up the Introductory Session Exercises is October 19.**

Please ensure you have Anaconda Python (>3.6) installed on your computer
for the hands-on sessions. [Download Anaconda]({{< ref "/docs/python/020_Get_Python/" >}})


### Introductory Exercises

The four introductory exercise sets, **which must be submitted as a single PDF through Brightspace by October 19th**, can be found below. The first set (Python) are weighted double, so the breakdown of marks will be:

|Exercise | Weighting| Documents |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Python  | 40%      | [Stage3_Python_Problems_2020.pdf](https://veritas.ucd.ie/~quinn/labs_master/docs/2020/Stage3_Python_Problems_2020.pdf) |
| Data Analysis I | 20% | [Jupyter Notebook template I](https://veritas.ucd.ie/~quinn/labs_master/docs/2020/AdvLabDataWeek1-Sept2020.ipynb), [counts.dat](https://veritas.ucd.ie/~quinn/labs_master/docs/2020/counts.dat) |
| Data Analysis II | 20% |  [Jupyter Notebook template II](https://veritas.ucd.ie/~quinn/labs_master/docs/2020/AdvLabDataWeek2-Sept2020.ipynb), [thermocouple.dat](https://veritas.ucd.ie/~quinn/labs_master/docs/2020/thermocouple.dat) |
| Statistics and Error Analysis | 20%| [Error_Analysis_Problems_2020.pdf](https://veritas.ucd.ie/~quinn/labs_master/docs/2020/Error_Analysis_Problems_2020.pdf) |

The introductory exercises are in place of one experiment for 2020-2021 and worth 2.5 credits.
