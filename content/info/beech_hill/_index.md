The UCD School of Physics has relocated to the L.M.I. Building in
Beech Hill from September 2023 whilst the Science Phase III upgrade is
in progress. This building is just beyond the edge of campus, less
than 200 m from UCD Nexus.

The Stage 3 and Stage 4 Advanced Laboratories are now located in the
L.M.I Building, Beech Hill, on the ground and first floors of the B
wing.
