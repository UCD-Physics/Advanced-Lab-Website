## Introductory Talk

The Stage 3 Advanced Laboratory Introductory Talk will be given by
Assoc. Prof. Emma Sokell at 2pm on Tuesday 13 September 2022 in
room Science South S1.67. [[Slides]](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2022/S3Intro/Stage3_Lab_Intro2223.pdf)


## Introductory Sessions

There will be three additional introductory lectures as part of the Stage 3 Advanced Laborarory:
* _Data Acquisition in Python_, Assoc. Prof. John Quinn, Wednesday 14 September at 14:00 (SCN 2.32),
* _Data Analysis_, Assoc. Prof. John Quinn, Wednesday 21 September at 14:00 (SCS 1.67)
* _Report Writing_, Prof. Emma Sokell, Thursday 22 September at 14:00 (SCS 3.56)

## Advanced Laboratory Dates

For trimester 1 the laboratories begin on Tuesday 13 September 2022 and
run until Thursday, 1 December 2022.

For trimester 2 the laboratories begin on Tuesday, 23 January 2023 and
run until Thursday 30 March 2023.

{{% callout note %}} The laboratories run during the two-week
field-work break (13 - 24 March 2023) and close four weeks before the
end of the trimester to enable all assessment to be complete before
written examinations start.  {{% /callout %}}

## Advanced Laboratory Aims

Amongst the main aims of the laboratory are the development of
critical thinking and problem solving skills. Therefore, the labs are
just not about the written report but also demonstrated
understanding of the problem being investigated and appropriate
experimental planning, execution, and analysis. It is important to
give sufficient time to doing the experiemnt and not to put all the
emphasis on writing the report.


## Laboratory Reports

Each experiment including write up should take approximately three
weeks for those doing four labs per trimester and approxiately 4.5
weeks for those doing two labs per trimester.  It is essential to plan
and utilise your time well.

As a rough guide, the time spent doing a main lab. experiment should
be split into roughly three equal duration parts:

* becoming familiar with the experiment, writing statement of intent,
   setting up and writing data acquisition code if relevant,

* carrying out and refining the experiment inlcuding preliminrary data
  analysis

* final analysis and report writing.
